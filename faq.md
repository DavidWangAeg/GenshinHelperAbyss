## Teambuilding

### What teams should I use for Abyss

While you could try to use a single team for all floors, Abyss teams tend to change per floor based on the Divergence \(floor buff\) and mobs on each floor. Here's a simple approach you can use:

1. Pick a **Main carry/DPS** to use. Check the build docs for recommendations on who can fit this role
2. Pick a **Healer** for the team. If possible, pick a character that synergizes with your main by providing buffs, reactions, or resonance.
3. If the floor contains **Elemental Shields**, add characters that can break those shields here. Check the individual Floor guides on what to bring
4. Fill in any remaining slots with **Supports** that help your main, often by providing buffs, reactions, or resonance

### What level should my characters be?

Always focus on levelling your **Main carry/DPS** first. The characters and their weapons should be **maxed out for your WL**. If your main carry is more than 10 levels below the mobs on the floor, it may be challenging to beat it.

**Support** characters do not need to be maxed out in the same way. Keep them **1-2 ascension levels lower than your Main carry/DPS**, up to their **60/70 ascension** \(meaning ascending from lvl 60, but not levelling them to 70\). This unlocks their last passive talent.

Characters only used for shield breaking do not need any levels at all. Their skills are equally effective at level 1 \(as long as you can keep them alive!\)

Once you get to the higher floors, you will always be lower level than the enemies on the floor. This is where investment into artifacts becomes important. We recommend you max out your carry at 80/80, and your supports at 70/80. The resources you would put into bringing a character to 90/90 will often be better spent bringing other characters and artifacts up
