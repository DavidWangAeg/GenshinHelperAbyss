# Debuffs

## Mechanics

Debuffs apply an **element** to the character, as well as a secondary effect based on the element.

| Element | Name | Effect |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)  |  **Smoldering Flames** | Active character takes![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) **DMG** once every second |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)  |  **Condensed Ice** | Increases **Stamina Consumption** by **2x** |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)  |  **Slowing Water** | Increases **Skill Cooldowns** by **2x** |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)  |  **Engulfing Storm** | Drains **5 energy** every 3 seconds |

All debuffs last **20 seconds**, or until **cleansed** by an elemental reaction \(see [Removing Debuffs](removing-debuffs.md)\).

Debuffs can either come from an **enemy** \(aura\), or be part of the **stage** \(divergence in Domain/Abyss\). The two work slightly differently

| Enemy | Stage |

| **Timer \(Stage\)** | 30s |
| **Timer \(Aura\)** | 15s |
| **Duration** | 20s |

The main difference between enemy auras and Ley Line Disorders are that enemy auras are generally harder to cleanse with specific characters.

        <p>You can remove the debuff early by using elemental reactions, by getting

        <p>Some auras cannot be removed with specific elements because of elemental
          priorities or because the reactions cannot remove the element that causes
          the debuff.</p>
