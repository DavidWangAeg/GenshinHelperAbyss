4 bubbles spawn in a "+" pattern around the player. Touching them pops the bubble, causing you to take damage.

![Second set of bubbles spawn when you leave the first area](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_aura_2nd_set.gif)

Leaving the initial AoE will cause a **second set of bubbles** to spawn. Be careful not to dash out of the first set and into where the second set will spawn.

![Bubbles can be destroyed](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_aura.gif)

You can destroy the bubbles with attacks and abilities. Even if you destroy all the bubbles, leaving the initial AoE will spawn the second set.
