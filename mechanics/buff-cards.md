## Mechanics

![](../.gitbook/assets/benediction.jpg)

At the beginning of each chamber, you will be given a choice of 3 buff cards \(**benedictions**\). These come in two types:

* **Effective this floor \(blue\)** cards. These effects apply to the current chamber, and all remaining chambers in the floor.
* **Effective this chamber \(yellow\)** cards. These effects only apply to the current chamber.

**Floor Buffs** of the same type stack with each other.
