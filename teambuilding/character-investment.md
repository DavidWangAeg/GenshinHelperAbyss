## General Tips

#### Focus on investing on 2 Main DPS and 2-4 Supports

Spreading out your resources is a common reason players aren't able to progress through Abyss. If your goal is to get through Abyss, it's best to prioritize just a few characters.

#### Save your Fragile Resin until AR45

The highest level artifact domains **guarantee a 5**★ **artifact** with every run, and these unlock at **AR45**. Artifacts are key to beating higher floors of Abyss, and having a large stock of **Fragile Resin** as soon as you're able to access the highest level domains is the best way to gear up quickly.

#### Prioritize weapon levels

You can craft **enhancement ores** at the blacksmith without using resin. This makes weapon levels very resource efficient for damage. Prioritize keeping your main DPS weapon maxed out for your world level over other options.

## AR 1 - 29

You should expect to clear Floor 3 around **AR20-25**. Once you've gotten Xiangling, you can hold off on progressing through Abyss until higher ARs. Rewards in Floors 1- 8 don't reset, so there's no rush to do it.

### Artifacts

* Focus on equipping artifacts for their **set bonuses** and don't worry too much about artifact levels
* Look out for any **4**★ artifacts you find that have the correct **mainstat**. These can be worth levelling if you need more damage
