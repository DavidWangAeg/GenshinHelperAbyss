# Building a Composition

There's many different ways to approach teambuilding, however for Abyss it's not recommended to try to build a "perfect" 4 character team and use it for every single floor. Each floor has different divergences and monsters, so it's best to modify your teams to suit the floor.

## Teambuilding Approach

### Pick a core

Your core is responsible for dealing most of the damage for your team, and usually consists of a pair of characters with good synergy. These are the characters which you should prioritize investing in for weapons/artifacts/talents. 

For Abyss, you will need at least 1 core for each team. When starting a floor, look at the mobs and tips for the floor to decide which side each core should go on.

{% hint style="info" %}
If possible, try to use different types of damage between the two teams in order to avoid being heavily disadvantaged if a floor is bad for a specific element.
{% endhint %}

### Add supports

Which supports you choose for each team will vary depending on the specific requirements for the floor.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best supports will often fill in more than one of these categories. This is why pure healers like Barbara or Qiqi are not usually recommended over other more versatile supports like Bennet or Zhong Li.
{% endhint %}

#### Healer

Each team should have a character than can heal. While it's possible to run a strong shield character like Zhong Li instead of a healer, it's not recommended.

#### Shieldbreakers

Prioritize adding any elements you are missing for breaking enemy shields. You can find a list of required elements in the guide for each floor. 

#### Energy

Commonly referred to as a battery, these supports are the same element as the core character and are good at generating energy to keep their Bursts up more often, helping you deal more damage.

#### Crowd Control

Characters that are able to disable enemies in various ways. This will often be a character than can enable **Freeze** to disable enemies, or an ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) character whose abilities will pick up and knock down enemies.

#### Damage

These supports boost the damage of your core unit in some way, for example:

* Buffing your team \(**Bennet**, ****character using **Noblesse Oblige** set\)
* Debuffing your enemies \(**Zhong Li**, ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)using **Viridescent Veneer** set\)
* Adding resonance

## Cores

### Razor/Keqing + Cryo

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) 

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_keqing.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_qiqi.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_rosaria.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png)   |

* Make sure to regularly trigger **Superconduct** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) + ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) to reduce enemy ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **RES** for damage. The debuff lasts **8 seconds**.
* **Diona** and **Qiqi** are the preferred supports as they also fill in for you as a **healer**.

### Ningguang + Geo

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) 

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ningguang.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_albedo.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png)  |

* Usually you would want at least **C1** on **Ningguang** before using this comp to help with AoE damage.
* Free catalyst options are not great so you may also want to avoid this core if you don't have a **CRIT** substat catalyst to use.
* With two ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) chars, shield breaking can be an issue on some floors. In particular, this core can't cover all required elements on **Floor 7** of .

### Bennet + Chong

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) 

| DPS | Support |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png)  |

* This core is centered around the **Melt** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Use **Chongyun's Elemental Skill** to have **Bennett's** attacks apply ****![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) to an enemy before hitting it with **Bennett's Elemental Skill/Burst.**
* Even without a dedicated support build, **Bennett's Elemental Burst** should be enough healing to cover this team. You should not need a second healer.

### Diluc/Klee/Hu Tao + Hydro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)

* This core is centered around the **Vaporize** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)\) reaction. Apply![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media)to enemies and use a combination of skills and attacks from your DPS to trigger the reaction.

### Childe + Xiangling

In order to property utilize this, she needs sufficient **energy recharge** to make sure her **Elemental Burst** is ready as much as possible. This often means running a second ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F485abc41b72e4fb75fd6cf1b2c21d83a5da9a05c.png?generation=1615182625871961&alt=media)in a flex slot for resonance.

* This core is centered around the **Electrocharged** \(![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) reaction. Use a combination of talents that apply both elements to enemies for damage.
* Your![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) characters will give most of the damage while **off-field** and another character is attacking and applying ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media).

### Ganyu + Pyro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)

| DPS | Support |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png)  |

* This core is centered around the **Melt** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Use **Xiangling's Elemental Skill/Burst** to apply ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)to an enemy and then hit them with a **Full Charge Attack** from **Ganyu**.

* This core is centered around the **Freeze** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Apply  ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)to enemies and then use a combination of **Ganyu's Charged Attacks** and **Elemental Burst** to deal damage to **frozen** enemies.
* You will often want to run another ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)character in a flex slot to have ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**resonance**.
* **Xingqiu** can work, but is not ideal for this as you have to weave in regular attacks in between charged attacks.

### Xiao + Anemo 

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

* This core is focused around **Xiao's Elemental Burst** and **Plunge Attacks**. Use your ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)support to generate energy for **Xiao** when his **Burst** is on cooldown.
* **Venti** is no ideal for this as enemies caught in his **Elemental Burst** cannot be hit by **Xiao**.

| :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png) |

* This core works by combining the high damage scaling of both **Jean** and **Venti's Elemental Skills/Bursts**, the **cooldown reduction** from ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)**resonance**, and general high **energy generation** to continually output damage with their talents.
