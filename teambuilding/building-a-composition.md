There's many different ways to approach teambuilding, however for Abyss it's not recommended to try to build a "perfect" 4 character team and use it for every single floor. Each floor has different divergences and monsters, so it's best to modify your teams to suit the floor.

## Teambuilding Approach

### Pick a core

Your core is responsible for dealing most of the damage for your team \(usually 2 characters\). These are the characters which you should prioritize investing in for weapons/artifacts/talents. 

For Abyss, you will need at least 2 \(1 for each team\). If possible, try to use different types of damage between the two teams in order to avoid being heavily disadvantaged if a floor is bad for a specific element.

When starting a floor, look at the mobs and decide which side to put each of your core characters.

### Add supports

The remaining slots can be filled with various supports. These characters will be much less invested than your core characters. The specific requirements will change per floor, but the best characters for these slots will often fulfil more than one of the below roles.

#### Healer

Each team should have a dedicated healer. If possible, your healer should perform another role for your team. This is why pure healers like Barbara or Qiqi are not generally recommended for Abyss if you have other options.

#### Shieldbreakers

Prioritize adding any elements you are missing for breaking enemy shields. You can find a list of required elements in the guide for each floor. 

#### Energy

Commonly referred to as a battery, these supports are the same element as the core character and are good at generating energy to keep their Bursts up more often.

#### Crowd Control

Characters that are able to disable enemies in various ways. This will often be a character than can add **Freeze** to disable enemies, or an ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) character whose abilities will pick up and knock down enemies.

#### Damage

These supports boost the damage of your core unit in some way, for example:

* Buffing your team \(**Bennet, Noblesse Oblige** set\)
* Debuffing your enemies \(![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)using **Viridescent Veneer** set\)
* Adding resonance
