## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 40** 

![](../.gitbook/assets/2-1.png)

  
**Mutant \(Yellow\) Electric Slimes** will cause **Purple slimes** to emit electric shocks. Prioritize killing them when they appear.

## **Chamber 2**

**Monster Level - 40** 

**Monolith Defense**

![](../.gitbook/assets/2-2.png)

Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) to freeze enemies and prevent them from attacking the monolith.

Be careful using ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) as the floor is water and can become **Electrocharged.**

## **Chamber 3**

**Monster Level - 40**

![](../.gitbook/assets/2-3.png)

Focus the **Hydro Samachurls** first as they can heal each other.

Using ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) against **Hydro Abyss Mages** are effective at breaking their shields while also keeping them from attacking you.
