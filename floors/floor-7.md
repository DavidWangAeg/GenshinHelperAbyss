The floor has very strict element requirements:  
  
Each team needs a ****![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)  - your free options are ​![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2F-MVKTPJXzkfD7cQl9kZr%2F-MVK_BSWgxb2kRAIvYGt%2FUI_AvatarIcon_Amber.png?alt=media&token=5ed44853-bcab-47df-af93-e6c4f69de461)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) 

Each team needs a ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) - the only free option is ​![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png)   
If you have no other Cryo units, put **Kaeya** on Side 1 and focus the **Electrohammer first** on **Chamber 3 Side 2.**

Team 1 should have an ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) - your free option is ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_lisa.png)   
Team 2 should have a Hydro - your free option is Barbara  
Each team requires a Geo or Claymore character - your free options are Noelle, Geo MC. If possible, you should bring a Claymore that also fulfils one of the above requirements \(Razor, Beidou, Chongyun, Diluc\) instead of Noelle and Geo MC. For Team 1, you can also skip this step by using Overload to break Geo shields since that team already has a Pyro + Electro, but this can be slower
