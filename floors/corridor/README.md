# Abyssal Corridor \(F1-8\)

Your progress in the Abyssal Corridor **does not reset**. rewards for clearing and starring each floor can only be obtained once.

To advance to the next floor, you will need to at least 6★ the current floor. It's recommended you move on to the next floor as soon as you hit 6★ rather than trying to get the full 9★ on the current floor. Your goal at this stage should be to **reach Floor 9 as quickly as possible**, since the rewards there **reset twice a month**. Rewards from the Corridor are permanent, so you can always come back when you are more geared.
