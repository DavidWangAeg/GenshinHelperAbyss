## Divergence

* Your character will be periodically inflicted with **Slowing Waters**, greatly increasing your **skills' CD** duration until the inflicted ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) element is removed.
* ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **DMG** dealt by all party members increased by **75%**

## General Tips

**Bennet, Jean, Xinyan** can clear the **Slowing Waters** debuff, however it will take multiple ticks to do so for each character.

If possible, use characters that don't rely on skills as much like **Ganyu** or **Klee**, and avoid characters that do like **Diluc** or **Childe**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) **resonance** reduces the duration of ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) by **40%**, reducing the debuff duration from **20s** to **12s**. If you can, run two ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) chars in your team and time your cooldowns so you use skills while not debuffed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)character/DPS is **highly recommended** on Side 2 for the **Abyss Heralds**. Keeping them **Frozen** is the best way to deal with them.

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 88**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/11-1-1%20%281%29.png)

The units that aggro the monolith change between each wave. Focus in this order:

1. The **melee** hoarders
2. The **ranged** hoarders
3. The **crusher** \(hammer\) hoarder, and the **ranged** hoarder next to him
4. The **pugilist** \(no weapon\) hoarder, and the **ranged** hoarder next to him

Hoarders do significant damage to the monolith, so keeping them off it is a priority.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/11-1-2%20%281%29.png)

Only the **potioneers** aggro the monolith. Group them together and keep them staggered.

## Chamber 2

**Monster Level - 90**

### Side 1 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/11-2-1%20%281%29.png)

Focus the **Hydrogunner** first as he is able to heal allies. He spawns in the back, behind the other Fatui.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) is the best way to deal with the **Abyss Herald** shield, as it applies **Frozen**. Multiple ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) characters are recommended due to **Slowing Waters**.
