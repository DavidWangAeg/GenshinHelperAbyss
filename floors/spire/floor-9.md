* Characters on the field will continuously accumulate **Sheer Cold**, and will continually lose HP after Sheer Cold reaches its limit
* Opponents will attack the **Ruin Braziers**, preventing them from diminishing the effects of Sheer Cold in the area. Deactivated Ruin Braziers will restart after a while
