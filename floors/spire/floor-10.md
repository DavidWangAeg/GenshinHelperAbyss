# Floor 10

## Divergence

* Characters on the field will continuously accumulate **Sheer Cold**, and will continually lose HP after Sheer Cold reaches its limit
* **Warming Seelie** appear on the field, and will continually alleviate nearby characters' Sheer Cold

## General Tips

**Warming Seelie** will move around the room in a circle.

Keep an eye on your **Sheer Cold** gauge in this chamber. If you can't clear the mobs fast enough, you will want to try and lure enemies near the **Warming Seelie** if possible and fight near them.
