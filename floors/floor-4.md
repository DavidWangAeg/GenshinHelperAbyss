## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 50**

![](../.gitbook/assets/4-1.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) is the best at dealing damage to **Hydro Slimes** on this floor.

Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) on the **Hydro Abyss Mages** so they stay frozen in place and cannot attack. Their **Aura** \(Bubbles\) will still spawn when frozen

## **Chamber 2**

**Monster Level - 50**

**Monolith Defense**

![](../.gitbook/assets/4-2.png)

Most of the enemies that attack the monolith will be ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) . Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) to **Freeze** them and prevent them from damaging the monolith.

If you fight too close to the monolith, **Hilichurls** may hit the pillar by accident. Try not to fight directly next to the monolith

Both **Hydro Abyss Mages** target the monolith. Make sure you **Freeze** them as soon as possible. Avoid being near the monolith when the **Abyss Mages** are spawned as the **Bubbles** can damage it. You can also use characters with a **taunt** ability to distract enemies.

## **Chamber 3**

**Monster Level - 50**

![](../.gitbook/assets/4-3.png)

Target the **Hydro Samachurl** first as it can heal the other enemies.

In the second phase, target the **Hydro Abyss Mage** with the **Aura** to prevent bubbles from spawning. Make sure to continue attacking it after breaking it's shield, as they can recover the shield if left too long.
